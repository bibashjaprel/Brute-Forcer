# Directory Brute Forcer

Directory Brute Forcer is a Python script for brute forcing directories on a target website using a wordlist of common directory names. It provides a simple yet effective way to discover potential directories on a web server.

## Features

- Brute forces directories on a target website using a wordlist of common directory names.
- Prints found directories with their HTTP response status codes.
- Supports multi-threading for faster directory discovery.
- Customizable wordlist for directory brute forcing.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```
4.Install dependencies:

```bash
python brute_forcer/brute_forcer.py -u url # example:python brute_forcer/brute_forcer.py -u  https://example.com/  or python brute_forcer/brute_forcer.py -u https://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist
```
You will be prompted to enter the target URL and wordlist file path. The script will then attempt to brute force directories on the target website and print the results.
